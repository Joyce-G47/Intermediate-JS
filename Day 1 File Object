The File interface provides information about files and allows JavaScript in a web page to access their content.

File objects are generally retrieved from a FileList object returned as a result of a user selecting files using the <input> element, or from a drag and drop operation's DataTransfer object.

A File object is a specific kind of Blob, and can be used in any context that a Blob can. In particular, FileReader, URL.createObjectURL(), createImageBitmap(), and XMLHttpRequest.send() accept both Blobs and Files.
